/* This module provides an implementation of ElligatorSwift as well as
 * a version of x-only ECDH using it.
 *
 * ElligatorSwift is described in https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/759 by
 * Chavez-Saab, Rodriguez-Henriquez, and Tibouchi. It permits encoding
 * public keys in 64-byte objects which are indistinguishable from
 * uniformly random.
 *
 * Let f be the function from pairs of field elements to point X coordinates,
 * defined as follows (all operations modulo p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 977)
 * f(u,t):
 * - Let C = 0xa2d2ba93507f1df233770c2a797962cc61f6d15da14ecd47d8d27ae1cd5f852,
 *   a square root of -3.
 * - If u=0, set u=1 instead.
 * - If t=0, set t=1 instead.
 * - If u^3 + t^2 + 7 = 0, multiply t by 2.
 * - Let p = u^3 + t^2 + 7
 * - Let m = u^3 - t^2 + 7
 * - Let v = (C * m / p - 1) * u / 2
 * - Let w = p / (C * t * u)
 * - Let x1 = v
 * - Let x2 = -u - v
 * - Let x3 = u + w^2
 * - Return the first of [x3,x2,x1] that is an X coordinate on the curve
 *   (at least one of them is, for any inputs u and t).
 *
 * Then an ElligatorSwift encoding of x consists of the 32-byte big-endian
 * encodings of field elements u and t concatenated, where f(u,t) = x.
 * The encoding algorithm is described in the paper, and effectively picks a
 * uniformly random pair (u,t) among those which encode x.
 *
 * If the Y coordinate is relevant, it is given the same parity as t.
 *
 * Changes w.r.t. the the paper:
 * - The u=0, t=0, and u^3+t^2+7=0 conditions result in decoding to the point
 *   at infinity in the paper. Here they are remapped to finite points.
 * - The paper uses an additional encoding bit for the parity of y. Here the
 *   parity of t is used (negating t does not affect the decoded x coordinate,
 *   so this is possible).
